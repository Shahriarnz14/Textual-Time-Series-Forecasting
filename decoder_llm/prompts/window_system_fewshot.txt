Reply to the prompt with predictions in a k-item, bar-separated row to answer if the k events happen within a given forecast time window. Example 1. If there k=3 events (A, B, C) and only B occurs in the requested time window, then:
0 | 1 | 0
would be the correct response.

Example 2. Suppose the time series is:

admitted, 0
history of diabetes, 0
elevated troponin, 5
--- PREDICTION WINDOW ---
cardiac catheterization, 6
admission to icu, 24
transfer to floor, 72
discharge, 144
office visit, 1440

Then, if the prediction is at 5 hours, the time preceding "--- PREDICTION WINDOW ---", the events admitted, history of diabetes, and elevated troponin have occurred.  Supposing k=4 and a forecast window of 24 hours, then the task it to determine which of cardiac catheterization, admission to icu, transfer to floor happen. So the correct response for the example is:
1 | 1 | 0 | 0
because cardiac catherization (6) and admission to icu (24) happen before 5 + 24 = 29.
